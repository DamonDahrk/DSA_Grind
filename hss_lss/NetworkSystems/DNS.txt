DNS Actually Works

This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) helps. It acts as a translator between 
human-readable domain names and machine-friendly IP addresses.

The Journey of a DNS Query

1. The Browser Cache

The browser’s first checks is its own cache. It checks whether it has recently 
resolved the domain you’re trying to visit.

2. The Operating System Cache
If the browser doesn’t know, it turns to your computer’s operating system.

The OS maintains its own local cache of recent domain lookups, shared across applications.

3. The Recursive Resolver
If the OS doesn’t have the answer, your computer sends the query to a special server 
called a Recursive Resolver.

This resolver is usually operated by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or a public DNS service like:

Google DNS: 8.8.8.8

4. The Root Servers

If the resolver doesn’t already have the answer in its cache, it starts its search at the very top of the
 internet's hierarchy: the Root Servers.

 There are only 13 sets of these root servers globally (though they are replicated in hundreds of locations for reliability).

Root servers don’t know the final IP, but they know where to look next.

They looks at the last part of the domain (.com in google.com) and direct the resolver to the appropriate Top-Level Domain 
(TLD) server.

5. The TLD Servers (top level domain)
The resolver now talks to the TLD servers. The TLD server manages all domains ending in a specific
 extension, like .com, .org, .gov, .in, etc.

 The TLD server doesn't have the final IP address either. However, it knows which server is the official 
 record-keeper for the google.com domain. 

 6. The Authoritative Name Server

Finally, the resolver contacts the authoritative name server. This server is the ultimate source of truth for a specific domain. 
It holds the official DNS records for google.com and knows the exact IP address.

7. Back to the Browser
The recursive resolver now has the IP address. It passes this information back to your 
computer. Your computer then caches 
this answer so it doesn't have to repeat the whole process next time.

4. What Makes DNS Fast and Reliable?

1. Global Anycast Networks
Root servers and public resolvers (like Cloudflare or Google DNS) use anycast routing, 
which means
 the same IP address is advertised from many locations around the world.

 2. Redundant Authoritative Servers
Domains usually have more than one authoritative name server, spread across different regions.

If one server fails or becomes unreachable, another can respond.

3. GeoDNS
Some domains use geographic-based DNS responses.

The same domain may resolve to different IP addresses depending on 
where the request originates.

Load Balancing with DNS
DNS can return multiple IP addresses for a single domain.

With multiple A records or CNAMEs, traffic gets distributed across several servers.

 Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
Many websites rely on CDNs to speed up content delivery.

DNS queries resolve to an edge server located near the user.
