IP Addresses
, in the common IPv4 address 192.168.1.10 with a standard subnet mask, the breakdown is:

Network ID: 192.168.1
Host ID: 10

Host ID: This part of the address identifies a specific device within that network.
Network ID: This part of the address identifies the specific network the device is on. 

Routers primarily look at the Network ID. 

The biggest issue with IPv4 is address exhaustion. With the explosion of internet-connected
 devices, the ~4.3 billion addresses have effectively run out.

 Format
It is written as four numbers separated by dots (dotted-decimal notation), where each number 
is an "octet" ranging from 0 to 255 (e.g., 172.217.167.78).

IPv6: The Modern Standard

It's a 128-bit address, providing a staggering 2128 (or 340 undecillion) unique addresses.

t is written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons 
(e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). Zeros can be compressed for brevity.

Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC): 
Devices can generate their own IP address without needing a DHCP server.
Built-in Security: IPsec, a suite of protocols for securing communications, 
is a mandatory part of IPv6.
Efficient Routing: Simplified packet headers allow for faster processing by routers.

Public IP Address: This is a globally unique address that is routable on the internet. Your 
Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns one to your router. When you visit a website,
 your request is sent from your public IP.

 Private IP Address: This is an address used within a local, private network 
 (like your home Wi-Fi or an office LAN). These addresses are not routable on the internet
  and are reused in millions of private networks worldwide.

  So how do devices with private IPs access the internet?

Through Network Address Translation (NAT).

Your home router acts as a NAT gateway. It takes requests from devices on your private network, 
replaces their private source IP with its single public IP,

6. Static vs Dynamic IP Addresses

Static IP: A static IP address is manually configured for a device and does not change. This 
is essential for servers, printers, and other devices that need to be consistently 
reachable at the same address.

Dynamic IP: A dynamic IP address is assigned automatically by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
server. Most consumer devices (laptops, phones) get dynamic IPs. The address is leased for 
a period and can change the next time you connect.

7. Subnetting and CIDR

As networks grow, it's often necessary to divide them into smaller, more manageable segments. 
This process is called subnetting.

Subnetting involves "borrowing" bits from the Host ID part of an IP address to create more Network IDs.

A subnet mask is used to tell devices which part of the address is the network and which is the host.

This is where CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) comes in. 

Loopback Address: 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) and ::1 (IPv6). This address, also known as "localhost," 
always refers to the local device itself.
