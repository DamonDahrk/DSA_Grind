Both TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate at the 
Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. Their job is to take data 
from an application on one device and deliver it to an application on another.

Choosing between them is a critical system design decision.
