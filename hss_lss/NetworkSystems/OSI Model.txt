The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework 

Its primary purpose is to:

Standardize Communication: Provide a common language and framework for network designers and developers.
Ensure Interoperability: Allow different hardware and software from various vendors to communicate seamlessly.
Promote Modular Design: Break down complex networking tasks into smaller, more manageable layers, making development and troubleshooting easier.

Overview of the OSI Model

The OSI model divides the process of network communication into seven distinct layers,

A crucial concept is encapsulation: As data moves down the stack at the sender, 
each layer adds its own "header" 

Layer 1 – Physical Layer
The Physical Layer is responsible for the actual transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s) over the 
physical communication medium.
Examples: Ethernet cables (Cat 5e, Cat 6), fiber optics,

Layer 2 – Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer ensures reliable transmission of data between directly connected nodes
 (i.e., devices on the same local network segment). It handles framing (dividing data 
 into manageable units), physical addressing (using MAC addresses), and error 
 detection/correction for the local link.
 
 Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi 

 Layer 3 – Network Layer
 The Network Layer is responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses) and routing data
  packets across potentially multiple interconnected networks. It determines the 
  best path for data to travel from source to destination.

  Protocols: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol),

  Layer 4 – Transport Layer

  The Transport Layer provides end-to-end communication between processes (applications) on different hosts.
  Protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

  Layer 5 – Session Layer

  The Session Layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating communication sessions
   between applications. 

   xamples: While less distinct in modern TCP/IP implementations, concepts like RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
    sessions or WebSocket connections align with this layer's purpose.

Layer 6 – Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer ensures that data is in a usable format for the Application Layer. 
It handles data translation, encryption/decryption, compression/decompression, and 
serialization/deserialization.

Examples: SSL/TLS (encryption), JSON, XML

Layer 7 – Application Layer

The Application Layer is the closest to the end-user. It defines how applications
 interact with the network and provides user-facing services. This is where your 
 actual software logic often resides.

Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, gRPC, WebSocket.

2. Encapsulation and Decapsulation in Action

AppLayer L7 -> Your browser creates an HTTP GET request
PresLayer L6 -> The data is prepared, possibly compressed, and then encrypted by TLS.
Session Layer (L5): A TLS session is managed.
TransportLayer L4 ->  The encrypted data is segmented (if too large) and a TCP header is added, 
including source and destination port numbers (e.g., SRC=50000, DEST=443)

Network Layer (L3): An IP header is added, containing the source IP address
 of your computer and the destination IP address of the web server. This unit 
 is now an IP packet.

 Data Link Layer (L2): An Ethernet header and trailer are added, containing the 
 source MAC address of your network card and the destination MAC address of your 
 router (for the first hop). This unit is now an Ethernet frame.

 Physical Layer (L1): The frame is converted into raw electrical signals or light 
 pulses and sent over the physical medium (e.g., Wi-Fi radio waves, Ethernet cable).

 At the web server, the process reverses:

 Physical Layer (L1): Electrical signals are received and converted back into an Ethernet frame.
Data Link Layer (L2): The Ethernet header/trailer is removed, MAC addresses are checked. 
The IP packet is extracted.

Network Layer (L3): The IP header is removed, and the destination IP is checked. 
The TCP segment is extracted.

Transport Layer (L4): The TCP header is removed, destination port (443) is checked, and 
segments are reassembled. The encrypted data is passed up.

Session Layer (L5): The TLS session is managed.
Presentation Layer (L6): The data is decrypted by TLS and decompressed.
Application Layer (L7): The original HTTP GET request is delivered to the web server 
application, which then processes it.

While the OSI model is a powerful theoretical tool, the TCP/IP model is the one that's
 actually implemented and used by the Internet. It's a more pragmatic, consolidated model,
  typically with four layers:

 tcp/ip used -> L7-L5 App Layer (User facing apps)
 Transport -> L4 -> End to End comm (TCP/UDP)
 Internet -> L3 -> Logical Addressong routing IP
 Network Access -> L1/L2 -> Phys media local network links
