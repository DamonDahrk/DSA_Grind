Proxies and reverse proxies are servers that sit between clients and servers to improve security, 
privacy and performance.


The user types a website URL into their browser. The request is intercepted by the proxy server 
instead of going directly to the website.

The proxy server examines the request to decide if it should forward it, deny it, or serve a cached copy.

If the proxy decides to forward the request, it contacts the target website. 
The website sees only the proxy server’s IP, not the user’s.

When the target website responds, the proxy receives the response and relays it to the user.

Key Benefits of Proxy Servers:

 Privacy and Anonymity Proxy servers hide your IP address by using their own
Access Control: Organizations use proxies to enforce content restrictions 
Security: Proxies can filter out malicious content and block suspicious sites
Improved Performance: Proxies cache frequently accessed content, reducing latency and improving load times for websites.

While both hide your IP, a VPN encrypts all your internet traffic unlike Proxy Servers

One of the most common uses of proxy servers is bypassing geographic restrictions

Streaming services, for instance, often offer different content based on a user’s location. 
With a proxy server based in the target region, you can access that region’s content library 
as if you were a local user.

eg. Netflix US Media can be consumed by connecting to US proxy server 

Proxies can store cached versions of frequently accessed content, enabling 
faster load times and reducing bandwidth usage.

When a user requests cached content, the proxy server serves the stored copy rather than 
fetching it from the destination server, which reduces latency.


To avoid stale content, it uses a Time-To-Live (TTL) value, automatically expiring cached 
data after the configured time

A reverse proxy is the reverse of a forward proxy. It regulates traffic 
coming into a network.

It sits in front of servers, intercepts client requests and forwards them to
 backend servers based on predefined rules.

 Think of a reverse proxy as a gatekeeper.

 Instead of hiding clients from the server, it hides servers from clients.
THIS IS TO GIVE L to DDos and hackers

A user types a website URL into their browser, which sends a request to the server.

The reverse proxy server receives the request before it reaches the backend servers.

Based on predefined rules (like load balancing or server availability), the reverse proxy 
forwards the request to the apt backend server.

The backend server processes the request and sends a response back to the reverse proxy.

The reverse proxy relays the response to the client, with the client never directly interacting with the 
backend servers.

Key Benefits of Reverse Proxy :
->Enhanced Security: By acting as a protective layer, a reverse proxy hides backend servers from clients
-> Load Balancing :  A reverse proxy can distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple backend servers,
 improving system reliability
 ->Caching Static Content: Reverse proxies can cache static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript
 -> SSL Termination: Reverse proxies can handle SSL encryption, offloading this work from backend servers.
-> Web Application Firewall (WAF): Reverse proxies can inspect incoming requests, acting as a firewall to detect and 
block malicious traffic.

Cloudflare’s reverse proxy is widely used by global websites and applications to boost speed, security, and reliability.
