checksum answers the question: "Has this data been altered unintentionally or maliciously since it was created, 
stored, or transmitted?"

A checksum is a unique fingerprint attached to the data before it's transmitted.

When the data arrives at the recipient's end, the fingerprint is recalculated to
 ensure it matches the original one.

 Checksums are calculated by performing a mathematical operation on the data, such as adding up all the bytes or running it 
 through a cryptographic hash function.

 Calculation: Before sending or storing data, the original data is processed through a 
 specific algorithm to produce a checksum value.

-> The checksum is appended to the data and sent over the network
 or saved in storage.

Verification: Upon reception, the checksum is recalculated using the same 
algorithm on the received data. This newly calculated checksum is compared with the
 original checksum.

Error Detection: If the two checksum values match, the data is considered intact.
 If they do not match, it indicates that the data has been altered or corrupted during 
 transmission or storage.

 Types of Checksums:

 Parity Bit: A parity bit is a single bit that is added to a group of bits to make the total number of 1s 
 either even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). 

CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check): It works by treating the data as a large binary number and 
dividing it by a predetermined divisor. 

Cryptographic Hash Functions: These are one-way functions that generate a fixed-size hash
 value from the data. Popular examples include MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256.
