In a distributed system, it may happen that multiple nodes are processing large
 computations distributedly and they need to know the results of each node to keep 
 them updated about the whole system. In such a situation, the nodes need to agree upon 
 a common value. This is where the requirement for consensus comes into the picture.

 How to achieve Consensus in Distributed System

 Case 1: All the nodes can carry out their task keeping v as the value in their mind.

Case 2: Suppose one of the nodes suggests “I prefer value w”. In this type of situation 
achieving consensus is complicated.

To achieve consensus all the nodes

Agreement: All non-faulty nodes should agree on the same value.
Validity: If a system has decided on a value v then that value should be suggested by one of the non-faulty nodes of the system and all other non-faulty nodes must decide that value v.
Termination: Every non-faulty node should agree upon some value. If one of the non-faulty nodes agrees upon value v, consensus can not be achieved.

Challenges 

Crash failure occurs when a node is not responding to other nodes of the system due to some hardware or software or network fault.

Byzantine failure is a situation where one or more node is not crashed but behaves
 abnormally and forward a different message to different peers, due to an internal 
 or external attack on that node

 Consensus Algorithms
Voting-based Consensus Algorithms
Some of the first implementations of consensus algorithms began to employ various voting-based techniques.

If more than two-thirds of all nodes in a system are honest then consensus can be reached.

There are several Proof-based Consensus algorithms —

Proof of Work (PoW)
Proof of Stake (PoS) etc…

Application of Distributed Consensus
Consensus algorithms are used in many real-world applications in distributed or decentralized networks —

✅ Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
✅ Google page-rank
✅ Load balancing etc…
