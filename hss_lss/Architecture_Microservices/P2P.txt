Peer-to-peer (P2P) is defined as a decentralized network architecture in which 
participants, called peers, interact directly with each other without the need for a 
central authority or server.

P2P networks are decentralized, meaning no central server or authority controls the network. Instead, each participant or peer has equal capabilities and responsibilities. Peers interact directly with each other, 
sharing resources and services without relying on a central point of control

P2P networks are self-organizing systems. As peers join and leave the network, the network dynamically adjusts and reorganizes itself.

P2P networks are designed for efficient resource sharing among peers. Peers can contribute their own resources, such as bandwidth, storage, processing power, or content, to the network and make them available to other peers

P2P networks facilitate direct communication between peers. Peers can interact with each other without intermediaries, allowing for efficient and real-time communication.

P2P networks are inherently scalable. As more peers join the network, the available resources and capabilities increase. 

P2P networks exhibit fault tolerance and redundancy. Since there is no central point of control,

Lack of centralized control: The absence of centralized control in P2P networks can lead to challenges in managing and coordinating network activities.

Network management complexity: P2P networks can be more challenging to manage than client-server architectures. 

Dependency on peer availability: The availability of resources and services in a P2P network depends on the active participation of peers. 

Security risks: P2P networks can introduce security risks if proper precautions are not taken. 

Performance and efficiency variability: The performance of a P2P network can be influenced by factors such as the number and quality of participating peers, their available resources

Key Applications of Peer-To-Peer Networks

File sharing
P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing. One well-known example is BitTorrent,

 Instant messaging
P2P technology can be used for instant messaging applications. For instance, applications such as Skype and WhatsApp

Cryptocurrency
Peer-to-peer networks are integral to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In this context, a P2P network facilitates transactions between users without needing a central bank or financial institution.

CDNs

 Virtual private networks (VPNs)
Some VPN services utilize P2P connections to establish secure and private communication between users. In a P2P-based VPN,
