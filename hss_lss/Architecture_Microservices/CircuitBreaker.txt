The Circuit Breaker design pattern is used to stop the request and response process if a
 service is not working, as the name suggests.

prevents cascading failures 

 As an example, assume a consumer sends a request to get data from multiple services. But, 
 one of the services is unavailable due to technical issues. There are mainly two issues 
 you will face now.

First, because the consumer will be unaware that a particular service is unavailable (failed),
 so the requests will be sent to that service continuously.
The second issue is that network resources will be exhausted with low performance and 
user experience.

You can leverage the Circuit Breaker Design Pattern to avoid such issues.

When the number of failures reaches a certain threshold, the circuit breaker trips for 
a defined duration of time.

During this timeout period, any requests to the offline server will fail. When that time
 period is up, the circuit breaker will allow a limited number of tests to pass,
  and if those requests are successful, the circuit breaker will return to normal 
  operation.

 The circuit breaker’s basic concept is to wrap a protected function call in a circuit
  breaker object that monitors for failures. When the number of failures reaches a certain 
  threshold, the circuit breaker trips, and all req return with an error.

  The Circuit Breaker pattern has 3 states.

Open.
Closed.
Half-Open.
