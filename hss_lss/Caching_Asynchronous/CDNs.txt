A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver 
web content based on the users geo locations

The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to end-users with high availability
 and performance by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.

 A CDN operates using three key components:

 Edge Servers – Located at Points of Presence (PoP) locations, these servers 
 cache and deliver content closer to users.

 Origin Servers – The primary servers where the original content is stored.

 DNS (Domain Name System) – Directs user requests to the nearest
  edge server instead of the origin server.

  By leveraging edge servers distributed across multiple geographical regions, 
  CDNs minimize latency and accelerate content delivery.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. User Request
A user visits a website and requests content, such as an image, a webpage, or a video. 

2. DNS Resolution

The browser sends a DNS query to resolve the web content address 
(e.g., https://cdn.example.com/images/logo.png) into an IP address.

The DNS return the nearest CDN edge server’s IP address rather than the origin server.

3. Cache Check
If the content is already cached at the edge server, it is served immediately to the user.

If not, the edge server forwards the request to the origin server. 
The origin server processes the request and sends the content back to the edge server.
 The edge server caches the content it retrieved from the origin server.

4. Subsequent Requests
Once cached, future requests for the same content are served directly from the edge server

CDNs use a Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism to determine how long content 
remains cached before expiring.

3. Benefits of Using a CDN

Faster Load Times BY USING EDGE servers, 

Reduced Server Load CDNs offload traffic from the origin server by caching static assets, 

Improved Availability and Reliability – With multiple servers in different locations NO SPOFs

Scalability: CDNs can handle traffic spikes more efficiently than traditional hosting,

Global Reach: CDNs make it easier to deliver content to users worldwide

Enhanced Security – Many CDNs offer DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs),

issues: INC COST, INC COMPLEXITIES

Use Cases of CDNs
Video Streaming & OTT Platforms
CDNs optimize video content delivery by caching video files closer to users,
 minimizing buffering and latency.
 Online Gaming
Multiplayer online games require low-latency content delivery
 to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

 Content & Media Distribution
News websites and content platforms deliver images, articles, and 
videos through a CDN to handle large traffic spikes.

eg. Cloudflare, Fastly, GOOGLE cloud CDNs, Azure CDNs
