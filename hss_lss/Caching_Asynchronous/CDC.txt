Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern used to track and capture changes in a 
database (inserts, updates, deletes) and stream those changes in real time to 
downstream systems.

This ensures downstream systems remain in sync without needing expensive batch jobs.

1. How CDC Works

When a change occurs, CDC captures the change event and makes the 
information available for processing.

   capturing changes              publish to stream               Consume Events 
DB -----------------> CDC Engine    ------------->   Message Queue -------------->  Downstream
                       Insert Update                                              Applications
                        Delete 

The process typically involves: Monitoring, Capturing , Delivering

2. CDC Implementation Approaches

2.1 Timestamp-Based CDC
This approach relies on adding a last_updated or last_modified column to your database tables.
Simplicity , No External Dependencies, 

Cons:
Incomplete Capture: This method may not capture deleted records 
since the timestamp is typically updated on existing rows.    

Performance Overhead: As your data grows, frequent querying based on timestamps can impact performance

2.2 Trigger-Based CDC

Trigger-Based CDC involves setting up database triggers that automatically log changes to a 
separate audit table whenever an insert, update, or delete operation occurs.

Pros:
Real-Time Capture: Triggers capture changes immediately when they occur.
Detailed Auditing: Offers a granular record of changes, including before-and-after 
values, which is useful for audit trails and debugging.

Cons:
Performance Impact: Triggers execute during the transaction, potentially slowing down database
 write operations.
Complexity in Maintenance: Changes in database schema often require corresponding updates
 to trigger definitions.

 2.3 Log-Based CDC

 An online news platform uses caching to speed up page loads for popular articles.
 However, when an article is updated (e.g., a correction is issued or new content 
 is added), the cache must be invalidated to prevent serving stale content.

  CDC, changes in the content database are captured and automatically trigger cache updates,

  4. Implementing CDC with Debezium and Kafka

  Step 1: Set Up Kafka and Debezium
  Step 2: Configure Debezium Connector for MySQL
  Step 3: Listen for Changes
Once the Debezium connector is properly configured and running, it starts capturing change events 
from the MySQL database.

5. Challenges and Considerations: Schema Evolution: Databases evolve over time,
 A robust CDC pipeline must gracefully adapt to schema alterations

 High Throughput Handling: In high-transaction environments, large volumes of data
  changes can occur rapidly. It’s essential to design a CDC system that can process
   and relay these events efficiently to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.

   Ordering Guarantees: Maintaining the correct sequence of events is critical,

 Security and Compliance: Because CDC involves capturing detailed data changes, 
 it can expose sensitive information if not properly managed.
