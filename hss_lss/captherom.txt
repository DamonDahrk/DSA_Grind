CAP = Consistency, Availibility, Partition Tolerance 

It is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide all 
three guarantees.

Consistency (C): Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

Availability (A): Every request (read or write) receives a non-error response, without
 guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

Partition Tolerance (P): The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of 
messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.

Consistency :

In a consistent distributed system, if you write data to node A, a read operation from node B 
will immediately reflect the write operation on node A.

Financial Systems -> Balance Inquiry must reflect the most upto date state of an account

Availibility:

This means that the system remains operational and responsive, even if the response 
from some of the nodes don’t reflect most up-to-date data.

eg. Online retail systems 

Partition Tolerance

A network partition occurs when a network failure causes a distributed system to split into two
 or more groups of nodes that cannot communicate with each other.

 When there is a network partition, 
 the system must choose between Consistency and Availability.

 CAP TradeOff -> 2 of 3

CP ->   These systems prioritize consistency and can tolerate network partitions,
 but at the cost of availability.
 During a partition, the system may reject some requests to maintain consistency.

 Banking systems typically prioritize consistency over availability since data accuracy 
 is more critical than availability during network issues.

 AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) -> 

  During a partition, different nodes may return different values for the same data.

  Amazon's shopping cart system is designed to always accept items, prioritizing availability.

When you add items to your Amazon cart, the action almost never fails,
 even during high traffic periods like Black Friday.

 CA (Consistency and Availability):


 In the absence of partitions, a system can be both consistent and available.
  However, network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems, making this 
  combination impractical.

  Practical Design Strategies:

  1. Eventual Consistency

  Eventual consistency can provide a good balance where updates
   are propagated to all nodes eventually, but not immediately.

   Systems where immediate consistency is not critical, 
   such as DNS and content delivery networks (CDNs).

   2. Strong Consistency

   A model ensuring that once a write is confirmed, any subsequent
    reads will return that value.

    Systems requiring high data accuracy, like financial applications 

    3. Tunable Consistency

    Tunable consistency allows systems to adjust their consistency levels based
     on specific needs, providing a balance between strong and eventual consistency.

      e-commerce platforms where order processing requires strong consistency 
      but product recommendations can tolerate eventual consistency.

      4. Quorum-Based Approaches:

      Quorum-based approaches use voting among a group of nodes to ensure 
      a certain level of consistency and fault tolerance.

      Example: Systems needing a balance between consistency and availability,
      often used in consensus algorithms like Paxos and Raft.

If there is a partition (P), the trade-off is between availability and consistency (A and C).

Else (E), the trade-off is between latency (L) and consistency (C).

This theorem acknowledges that even when the system is running normally, 
there's a tradeoff between latency and consistency.

CAP Theorem is a powerful tool for understanding the inherent trade-offs 
in distributed system design.
