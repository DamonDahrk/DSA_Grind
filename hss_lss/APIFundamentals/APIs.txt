API stands for Application Programming Interface.

At its core, an API is a bunch of code that takes an input and gives you predictable outputs.
Think of an API as a middleman that enables applications to interact
 without needing direct access to each other's code or database.

 Examples:

Weather API – If you provide a city name as input ("New York"), the API returns 
the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
Uber Ride API – If you provide a pickup and destination address,
 the API finds the nearest available driver and calculates the estimated fare.
Python's sorted() API – If you provide a list of numbers ([5, 3, 8, 1]), 
the API returns the sorted list ([1, 3, 5, 8]).

When engineers build APIs, they clearly define what inputs the API accepts and what outputs it produces,
 ensuring consistent behavior across different applications.

APIs follow a simple request-response model:
A client (such as a web app or mobile app) makes a request to an API.
The API (hosted on an API server) processes the request, interacts with the necessary
 databases or services, and prepares a response.
