http server -> systems

single server is a bad idea, because it is a single point of failure,
you have to provision a new server and restore everything from a backup,
switch DNS entry to that server,

spread out the server now (separate out the database)
single http server but atleast it is spreadm out, better than a single server, better resiliency

pitfall is that maybe one server has more intensive cpu usage than others
maybe due to large database or what not and slows the entire system down as a result.

Vertical Scaling -> Just get a bigger Single Server , bigger VM , throw more
hardware at a problem.

HORTIzontal Scaling -> Modern Approach -> multiple servers, load balancers ->
distribute the load -> single database

choose the simplest arch
